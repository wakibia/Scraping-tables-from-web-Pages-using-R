# Web Scraping Data From Tables in Web Pages

>- Most of the times you may be looking forward to get data from the web but it is existing in table format
>- You can choose to copy-paste which is tendious and also time-consuming. Another drawback of copy-pasting, is that you are likely to lose some of the information along the way
>- Fortunately, you can ease all the work by obtaining the entire tables from the web pages by performing simple scraping

We will be focusing with the `rvest` package which is core in performing web scraping

>- We will be scraping tables from Wikipedia page [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) 

![](D:/Shiny_apps_Dashboard/pl.jpg)

>- One major challenge with web scraping is that websites are prone to changes, fortunately, Wikipedia changes doesn't alter the structure of the page and that why it will be used.
>- We will clean the data for the **Top Ten Premier League Players** with the highest transfer fee


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## load packages
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(janitor)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, warning = FALSE)
```

>- Number of tables in the page

```{r parse url}
## url that contains the tables

url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"

## parse the page
wikipedia_page <- read_html(url)
page_tables <- 
  wikipedia_page %>% 
  html_table() 
## This returns a list of tables

## Check how many tables are in the list
length(page_tables)

```

>- Display the first five Tables in the list object returned

```{r tables within the web page}
for(i in 1:5){
  print(page_tables[[i]])
}

```

This is a table that we will finally select among the 29 tables within the page:

>- Below is the data obtained in it's raw format

```{r Player Transfer Tables}
Players_transfer <- page_tables[[19]]
Players_transfer

```

>- Perform little preprocessing on the data to make it ready for analysis


```{r Preprocess the data}

player_Transfers <- 
  Players_transfer %>% 
  ## Clean the names to standard R-naming
  clean_names() %>% 
  ## Rename the variables
  rename(Transfer_From = transfer,
         Transfer_to = transfer_2) %>% 
  ## Extract digits from fee_min string
  mutate(`Transfer_fee Million(Euros)`= str_extract_all(
    fee_min, '\\d+'
  ) %>% unlist() %>% as.numeric()
  ) %>% 
  ## Drop redundant variables
  select(-c(fee_min, reference_s))
  



player_Transfers
```
